D:\projects\idea_projects\countries-data\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:139: Warning: Attribute autoVerify is only used in API level 23 and higher (current min is 21) [UnusedAttribute]
            <intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedAttribute":
   This check finds attributes set in XML files that were introduced in a
   version newer than the oldest version targeted by your application (with
   the minSdkVersion attribute).

   This is not an error; the application will simply ignore the attribute.
   However, if the attribute is important to the appearance or functionality
   of your application, you should consider finding an alternative way to
   achieve the same result with only available attributes, and then you can
   optionally create a copy of the layout in a layout-vNN folder which will be
   used on API NN or higher where you can take advantage of the newer
   attribute.

   Note: This check does not only apply to attributes. For example, some tags
   can be unused too, such as the new <tag> element in layouts introduced in
   API 21.

D:\projects\idea_projects\countries-data\app\src\main\res\raw\web_app_manifest.json: Warning: The resource R.raw.web_app_manifest appears to be unused [UnusedResources]

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.

D:\projects\idea_projects\countries-data\app\src\main\res\mipmap-xxxhdpi\ic_launcher.png: Warning: Launcher icons should not fill every pixel of their square region; see the design guide for details [IconLauncherShape]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLauncherShape":
   According to the Android Design Guide
   (https://d.android.com/r/studio-ui/designer/material/iconography) your
   launcher icons should "use a distinct silhouette", a "three-dimensional,
   front view, with a slight perspective as if viewed from above, so that
   users perceive some depth."

   The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a
   filled square.

D:\projects\idea_projects\countries-data\app\src\main\res\mipmap-xhdpi\ic_launcher.png: Warning: The following unrelated icon files have identical contents: ic_notification_icon.png, ic_launcher.png [IconDuplicates]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDuplicates":
   If an icon is repeated under different names, you can consolidate and just
   use one of the icons and delete the others to make your application
   smaller. However, duplicated icons usually are not intentional and can
   sometimes point to icons that were accidentally overwritten or accidentally
   not updated.
